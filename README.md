# Calculator App
An example of a Calculator UI built with React Native and Ionic React
Able to convert Arabic numerals to Roman Numerals and vice versa.


### Included in this Project are App build with React Native and Ionic React
* Fully functional Calculator
* Custom buttons
* Atomic Designs Concept
* Arabic Numeral Calculation
* Roman Numeral Calculation

### How To run

### React Native

```javascript
cd ReactNative
yarn install
yarn ios // for iOS
yarn android // for Android
```
### Ionic React

```javascript
cd IonicReactApp
npm install
npx ionic serve
```

Note: for Ionic React running on browser, emulate the browser with mobile view for better result


### React Native Expo

https://snack.expo.dev/@jbagaresgaray/kartatestapp

```javascript
<div data-snack-id="@jbagaresgaray/kartatestapp" data-snack-platform="web" data-snack-preview="true" data-snack-theme="light" style="overflow:hidden;background:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid var(--color-border);border-radius:4px;height:505px;width:100%"></div>
<script async src="https://snack.expo.dev/embed.js"></script>
```



# Skills Test
## Test for React Native
* Write a React Native app that is a calculator, supporting addition, multiplication, division and subtraction
* It should work like every normal calculator: when you type an operation followed by the equal sign, it will display the result. For example if you type "4", "+", "2", and "=", the result area will display "6"
* The app should have a switch, when this switch is flipped it changes from Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc.) to Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, V) etc.
* When the flip is switched, not only the keys of the calculator will change to roman numerals, but also the number displayed in the result area will be a roman numeral.
* Put everything in a repository, in the README add instructions on how to run your app in local machine.
* Make the repository public and send us a URL.
PS the calculator will only be tested with small numbers. There will be no large numbers such as millions or hundreds of thousands.
PPS when you search for a way to convert from Arabic to Roman numerals, you can take inspiration from known solutions that you find on the web, but you have to choose a solution that in your opinion works well
